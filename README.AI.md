## Product Positioning

`codex-switch` is a local-first CLI for managing and switching Codex and Claude Code provider routing. It manages local provider records, projects Codex `model_provider` sections, writes the active top-level `model` / `model_provider` route, switches Claude Code `settings.json` profiles, and maintains backups around mutating commands.

In `0.4.1`, there are two managed workflows:
1. **Codex providers** — OpenAI-compatible provider records projected into `config.toml` / `auth.json`.
2. **Claude Code providers** (via `--claude` flag) — full `settings.json` profiles stored and switched atomically.

## Primary Workflow (Codex)

```bash
codexs init
codexs add <provider> --profile <model-provider-id> --model <model> --api-key <key> [--base-url <url>]
codexs switch <provider>
codexs status
codexs doctor
```

`--profile` means managed `model_provider` id alias. It is not the legacy Codex top-level `profile` selector.

## Claude Code Workflow

```bash
codexs add --claude <name> --from-file <settings.json>
codexs switch --claude <name>
codexs current --claude
codexs list --claude
codexs show --claude <name>
codexs show --claude <name> --reveal
codexs remove --claude <name> --force
```

Claude providers store the entire `settings.json` as an opaque blob. Switching replaces the whole file atomically with backup/rollback.

`show --claude` masks env values whose key matches `SECRET_KEY_PATTERN` and omits the raw `settings` blob, in both human and `--json` output. The payload carries `revealed` so renderers can tell masked from unmasked without re-deriving it. `--reveal` is a global flag that prints the real values and includes `settings`; it affects the Claude `show` path only, and is never applied by default. Codex `show --json` still returns the full `apiKey` — that is a documented automation contract and is unchanged.

## Current Command Surface

Document only these current commands:

```text
init
migrate
list [--claude]
show [--claude] [--reveal]
current [--claude]
status
config show
config list-profiles
add [--claude]
edit
switch [--claude]
remove [--claude]
import
export
backups list
backups prune [--keep N]
unlock [--force]
rollback
doctor
setup
```

`setup` is deprecated and only points callers to `init` or `migrate`.

`--claude` is accepted only by `add`, `switch`, `list`, `show`, `current`, and `remove`. On any other command it is refused with `INVALID_ARGUMENT` naming the supported set, rather than silently reported as Codex state.

All commands accept `--json` where the parser supports it, and `--codex-dir <path>`. `--codex-dir` refuses a following token that starts with `-` instead of taking it as the path value.

## State Model

Tool home:

```text
~/.config/codex-switch/
  codex-switch.json
  providers.json
  claude-providers.json
  backups/
  .codex-switch.lock
```

Target Codex directory:

```text
~/.codex/
  config.toml
  auth.json
```

Target Claude Code directory:

```text
~/.claude/
  settings.json
```

Managed projection for current Codex versions is route-first:

- top-level `model`
- top-level `model_provider`
- matching `[model_providers.<id>]`
- API-key auth projection in `auth.json`

Do not present top-level `profile` or `[profiles.*]` as the current managed runtime path. `--create-profile` writes the `[profiles.<id>]` section for older Codex builds that route through it; it is an explicit opt-in and is not the default projection. Those sections may otherwise be inspected for adoption or legacy diagnostics only.

Every write command takes one lock (`<toolHome>/.codex-switch.lock`, shared by both targets) and snapshots the files it touches into `backups/` first. Backup directory names are `YYYYMMDD-HHmmssSSS` and are created exclusively, so two mutations in the same second cannot collide; the directory's path is returned by the create rather than re-derived from the timestamp.

## Locks And Retention

- A killed process leaves its lock behind. `codexs unlock` clears it only when the recorded owner is provably gone; a live owner is refused because a false takeover corrupts state where a false conflict only inconveniences. `codexs unlock --force` is the documented override for a recycled pid. No lock present is success.
- There is no TTL-based takeover. A slow `migrate` can exceed any timer, so a pid that looks live is treated as live.
- Backups retain the newest 20 by default. `codexs backups prune [--keep N]` is the manual path and runs automatically after every successful mutation.
- A directory that any surviving manifest still references is never deleted, because rollback resolves through it. Directories whose manifest is missing or unreadable are reported rather than deleted.

## Current Non-Goals

`0.4.1` does not include:

- Copilot SDK integration.
- GitHub device-flow login.
- HTTP proxy bridge or local bridge worker runtime.
- Background runtime services, bridge logs, or bridge runtime state.
- Built-in third-party router packaging.
- Account systems or cloud sync.
- Claude Code plugin marketplace management.
- Generic "target" abstraction or pluggable provider type system.
- Field-based Claude provider creation (only `--from-file` import is supported).
- TTL-based lock takeover, or an audit log for takeovers.
- An exit-code taxonomy: success is `0`, failure is `1`.
- Deletion of the dead code trees (`src/infra/`, the dead `src/cli/` shims) — that is `P2-1`.

## Verification Commands

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
npm test          # in-process suite; prints nothing on success
npm run test:e2e  # real child processes; prints passed/failed/skipped
node dist/cli.js --help
node dist/cli.js --version
npm pack --dry-run
```
