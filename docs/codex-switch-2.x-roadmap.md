# codex-switch 2.x Roadmap

A review of `@minniexcode/codex-switch` as of `0.3.0`, plus a phased plan for the 0.3.x → 0.4.x line.

This is a **decision document**, not a fact source. It is deliberately not wired into the version
assertions in `tests/release-contract.spec.js`.

Every claim below cites `file:line` and was verified against the working tree, not inferred.

---

## 1. Where We Are

**Version.** The repository, `package-lock.json`, and the npm `latest` dist-tag are all at **`0.3.0`**
(`package.json:3`). `0.3.0` was published 2026-07-17 and is the "Claude Code provider switching
release" (`CHANGELOG.md:3-23`). There is no 2.0; the project is on a 0.x line.

**Shape.** 7,402 lines of TypeScript across 72 files. One runtime dependency: `inquirer`.
The 0.1.x copilot-sdk / HTTP bridge / proxy runtime was fully removed in 0.2.1
(`CHANGELOG.md:34`) and `package-lock.json` is clean — no SDK packages remain.

**Two targets, one tool home.**

| | Codex (default) | Claude Code (`--claude`) |
|---|---|---|
| Registry | `providers.json` | `claude-providers.json` |
| Projection | `~/.codex/config.toml` + `auth.json` | `~/.claude/settings.json` (atomic replace) |
| Record | `{ profile, apiKey, model?, baseUrl?, note?, tags? }` | `{ settings: {...}, note?, tags? }` |
| Commands | all 18 | 6 (`add` `switch` `list` `show` `current` `remove`) |

The `--claude` flag is a **parallel code path**, early-returned from `handleRegisteredCommand()`
before any Codex logic runs (`src/commands/handlers.ts:49-56` → `src/commands/claude-handlers.ts:53`).
This was a deliberate choice in the 0.3.0 design and this roadmap keeps it.

**Observed state on a real machine.** These numbers drove several findings below:

- `~/.config/codex-switch/backups/` holds **98 directories, 864 KB**.
- `claude-providers.json` holds 4 profiles (`copilot`, `copilot-pool`, `copilot-gpt`, `deepseek`).
  **Every one contains `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`**; `deepseek` also contains `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- `claude-providers.json` reports mode **`0666`** to MSYS `stat`. **That number is a synthetic
  POSIX view, not a real permission** — see the correction in P0-2.
- Leftovers from the removed integration are still on disk and are never read or cleaned up:
  `~/.config/codex-switch/github-token` (40 chars, shaped like a real GitHub PAT),
  `~/.config/codex-switch/runtime/copilot-bridge-state.json`, `.../copilot-bridge.log`.

---

## 2. Issue Inventory

### P0 — Security and data correctness

#### P0-1 · `show --claude` prints auth tokens in plaintext

`claudeShowProvider()` returns the raw `env` map **and** the complete `settings` blob
(`src/app/claude-show-provider.ts:25-26`), and the human renderer prints every env entry verbatim
(`src/cli/output.ts:392-398`). `--json` carries the same payload.

The Codex side does this correctly — `showProvider()` masks `apiKey` unless `includeSecret` is set
(`src/app/show-provider.ts:16-19`, `maskSecret()` at `src/domain/providers.ts:147-155`), and the
registry documents the guarantee (`src/commands/registry.ts:103`).

**Impact.** Every Claude profile on the observed machine carries a token, so
`codexs show --claude deepseek` prints a live credential into terminal scrollback, screenshots,
piped logs, and CI output.

**Fix (decided): mask by default, add `--reveal`.**

#### P0-2 · Managed files are written with default file permissions

There is **no `chmod` or `mode` call anywhere in `src/`** — the only `mode` match is an unrelated
merge-mode string in `src/app/import-providers.ts:98`. Everything inherits the process umask
(`src/storage/fs-utils.ts:15-24`), so the file mode is whatever the environment happens to hand out.

**Correction — the original evidence for this finding was wrong.** The `0666` recorded in the
first revision of this document was read from MSYS `stat` on Windows, where the POSIX mode is a
synthetic view. Measured afterwards: `chmod -R go-rwx` exits 0 and leaves every mode unchanged, and
`icacls` shows no `Everyone`, `BUILTIN\Users`, or `Authenticated Users` entry on
`~/.config/codex-switch`. "Any local user can read API keys" was therefore **not** true of this
machine; the real exposure is a different one (below). The underlying code gap is still real: on a
POSIX host the umask alone decides, and a permissive umask on a shared host exposes every managed
file.

**The exposure that actually exists, found via ACLs rather than modes.**
`C:\Users\A200477427\.claude` and `C:\Users\A200477427\.codex` each carry an **explicit**
`CodexSandboxUsers:(OI)(CI)(RX)` ACE. That group's only members are `CodexSandboxOffline` and
`CodexSandboxOnline` — the identities Codex's Windows sandbox runs commands as. So the Codex
sandbox can read `~/.claude/settings.json`, i.e. `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, in addition to
`~/.codex/auth.json`.

`~/.config/codex-switch` — `providers.json`, `claude-providers.json`, `github-token`, and all 98
backup directories — carries **no** such ACE; only SYSTEM, Administrators, and the owner. The files
this tool owns are the better-protected ones.

**Attribution and fix.** The ACE was written by the Codex CLI when it installed its sandbox, not by
codex-switch, and it is inherited by every file `switch --claude` writes into `~/.claude`. No
per-file POSIX `chmod` can remove it; it needs `icacls "…\.claude" /remove:g "CodexSandboxUsers"`.
Whether to remove it is a judgement call about the Codex sandbox's intended reach, so it is
recorded here rather than folded into the code fix.

#### P0-3 · Backups grow without bound and duplicate secrets

There is no prune, retention, or cleanup logic — `grep -rn "prune\|retention\|maxBackups\|cleanup" src/`
returns nothing. Every mutation copies the full previous state into a new directory
(`src/storage/backup-repo.ts:11-53`), including `providers.json` and `auth.json`, which hold keys.

**Impact.** 98 directories / 864 KB on the observed machine after a few months, containing an
unbounded plaintext key history. Nothing ever removes them.

#### P0-4 · Backup directory names collide within the same second

`createTimestamp()` has one-second resolution (`src/storage/backup-repo.ts:183-195`) and the backup
directory is `${timestamp}-${reason}` (`:17`). Two mutations with the same operation inside one
second resolve to the same path, and `ensureDir` succeeds silently (`:19`), so the second run
**overwrites the first backup's files and manifest**.

**Impact.** Silent backup loss. `rollback` then restores a state that is not the one it claims.

#### P0-5 · The "atomic" write is not atomic, and one write bypasses it entirely

`writeTextFileAtomic()` deletes the target and then renames the temp file over it
(`src/storage/fs-utils.ts:15-24`). The `rmSync` is what breaks atomicity — Node's `renameSync`
already replaces existing files on both Windows and POSIX. Between the `rm` and the `rename` the
target does not exist.

Separately, `writeOpenAiApiKeyAuth()` does not use the helper at all: it is a bare
`fs.writeFileSync` (`src/storage/auth-repo.ts:83`), making it the only non-atomic write on the
mutation path.

**Impact.** A concurrent reader can observe a missing file. A failed write to `auth.json` leaves it
truncated.

#### P0-6 · A stale lock blocks every write forever

`acquireLock()` records the owner's pid (`src/storage/lock-repo.ts:8-12`, `:30-49`) but nothing ever
reads it for liveness. There is no TTL and no force-unlock path. If the process is killed between
acquire and release, the lock file persists and **every subsequent write command** returns
`LOCK_CONFLICT` permanently. The only recovery is manually deleting
`~/.config/codex-switch/.codex-switch.lock`.

**Impact.** The user is locked out of their own tool with no supported way back.

#### P0-7 · Backup manifests are trusted for absolute restore paths

`restoreManifest()` copies to whatever absolute path the manifest names
(`src/storage/backup-repo.ts:58-81`), and `validateBackupManifest()` checks types only, never path
safety (`src/domain/backups.ts:22-64`). A tampered or corrupted `manifest.json` under `backups/`
turns `rollback` into an arbitrary file write.

**Impact.** Low likelihood, high consequence. Worth a containment check (restore only into the
recorded target directories).

---

### P1 — Correctness, robustness, portability

#### P1-1 · Boolean flags are parsed as value-taking options

The argument parser treats any `--x` followed by a non-`--` token as `--x <value>`
(`src/commands/args.ts:75-88`). So:

```
codexs remove --force packycode     # "--force" swallows "packycode"
```

leaves `positionals` empty (`src/commands/handlers.ts:301-303`), and the command falls through to an
interactive prompt or a "missing provider name" error.

This is the **root cause** of the `resolveClaudeProviderName()` workaround
(`src/commands/claude-handlers.ts:37-48`), whose own doc comment admits it exists to normalize the
parser's behaviour.

There is no notion of a boolean flag anywhere in the command registry.

#### P1-2 · `getSingleOption`'s `required` parameter is dead

```ts
return required ? null : null;   // src/commands/args.ts:149
```

Both branches return `null`. Callers that rely on the default (`required = true`) to enforce
presence — `src/commands/handlers.ts:181-182` — silently receive `null` instead of an error.

#### P1-3 · Unknown commands exit 0

An unresolvable token leaves `parsed.command === null`, which prints full help and calls
`process.exit(0)` (`src/cli.ts:52-55`). A typo like `codexs lst` looks like success to any script
or CI job.

#### P1-4 · Synchronous parse errors bypass the error envelope

`parseArgs()` throws synchronously (`src/commands/args.ts:25`), and `main()`'s synchronous section
has no `try`/`catch` (`src/cli.ts:27-28`). `codexs --codex-dir` with no value produces a raw stack
trace instead of the structured failure envelope, breaking the `--json` automation contract.

#### P1-5 · `status` renders a field that is never populated

`src/cli/output.ts:164` reads `data.storage.toolHome.root`, but `getStatus()` never returns a
`storage` key. The line always renders empty.

#### P1-6 · A computed value in `import` is discarded

`src/commands/handlers.ts:136-145` builds `buildManagedProfileViews(...).filter(...).map(...).sort()`
and throws the result away. The comment says the intent is to fail before mutation — but that is
already achieved by the `readStructuredConfig()` / `validateProvidersShape()` calls above it. The
chain itself is dead.

#### P1-7 · `export` writes plaintext keys with no warning

`exportProviders()` serializes the whole registry — including `apiKey` — to any user-specified path
with no caution (`src/app/export-providers.ts:11-34`); the result payload reports only
`{ exportedTo, count }`.

#### P1-8 · Error-detail masking only matches the substring `"apikey"`

`printErrorDetails()` skips detail keys whose lowercase name contains `apikey`
(`src/storage/fs-utils.ts:52-66`). `token`, `authorization`, `secret`, `api_key`, `auth_token` all
pass through, and nested objects are `JSON.stringify`'d wholesale.

Given Claude settings use `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, this is the same class of leak as P0-1 via a
different route.

#### P1-9 · Tests are not portable, and the Claude path has zero coverage

`tests/` contains `run-tests.js`, `helpers.js`, and two spec files.

- **Fixture gap.** `tests/helpers.js:8` points at `dev-codex/local-sandbox`, which is gitignored
  (`.gitignore:49`) and **does not exist in this checkout**. Three of the five `provider-workflow`
  tests depend on it, so the suite cannot run on a fresh clone.
- **No Claude coverage.** No test invokes a command with `--claude`. The entire 0.3.0 feature —
  `src/app/claude-*.ts`, `src/domain/claude-providers.ts`, `src/storage/claude-*.ts`,
  `src/commands/claude-handlers.ts` — shipped with no runtime test.
- **No coverage for** `show`, `current`, `config show`, `config list-profiles`, `edit`, `remove`,
  `import`, `export`, `backups list`, `rollback`, or any interactive flow.
- **Harness leaks temp dirs.** `makeSandboxCopy()` results are never removed, and `runBuiltCli()`
  only cleans up the tool home when the caller did *not* pass `toolHomeDir` — which every
  fixture-based test does.
- The harness calls `dist/` modules **in-process** (`tests/helpers.js:59-64`), so it never exercises
  the real `bin` entrypoint, exit codes, or process-level behaviour.

#### P1-10 · Rollback failure leaves no second chance

If `restoreManifest()` throws mid-restore, some files are restored and some are not; the thrown
`ROLLBACK_FAILED` reports the cause but there is no retry path and the backup is left in place. The
user is told the backup path, which is the minimum — but `writeTextFileAtomic` on the
`latest.json` pointer is not consulted in this path.

---

### P2 — Complexity and hygiene

#### P2-1 · `src/infra/` is an entire dead layer, and `src/cli/` is mostly dead too

`src/infra/` — 8 files — is **imported by nothing** in `src/` or `tests/`. Every file is a
"Compatibility facade" re-export of `../storage/*` or `../runtime/*`, e.g.
`src/infra/fs-utils.ts`, `src/infra/codex-paths.ts`, `src/infra/backup-repo.ts`.

The same applies to 5 of the 6 files in `src/cli/`: `args.ts`, `help.ts`, `interactive.ts`,
`prompt.ts`, `add-interactive.ts` are also self-described compatibility facades. Only `src/cli.ts`
and `src/cli/output.ts` are real.

Verified:

```
$ grep -rn "infra/" src/ tests/          → no matches
$ grep -rn "cli/args\|cli/help\|cli/interactive\|cli/prompt\|cli/add-interactive" src/ tests/  → no matches
```

This is the tangible remnant of a half-finished directory reorganisation — the old `cli`/`infra`
layout was superseded by `commands`/`storage`/`interaction`, but the old files were never deleted.
It means two names exist for every module, and a reader has to work out which is canonical.

#### P2-2 · Dead exports

Verified to have zero live callers:

| Location | Exports |
|---|---|
| `src/domain/config.ts` | `parseTopLevelProfile`, `parseProfileNames`, `replaceTopLevelProfile` (`:141-158`), `planProfileLifecycleOutcome` (`:508-564`), `DEFAULT_LINE_ENDING` (`:1143`) |
| `src/storage/config-repo.ts` | `readCurrentProfile` (`:45`), `listConfigProfiles` (`:58`), `ensureProfileExists` (`:65-67`, a stub that ignores both arguments), `updateTopLevelProfile` (`:135`), `requireManagedProfileRuntime` / `requireModelProviderRuntimeSection` (`:72`, `:115`) |
| `src/domain/providers.ts` | `findProviderByProfile` (`:125`) |
| `src/interaction/interactive.ts` | `confirmCreateCodexDir` (`:235`) |
| `src/commands/registry.ts` | `isKnownCommandName` (`:352`) + `COMMAND_NAME_SET` (`:286`) — `COMMAND_NAME_SET` is consumed only via that function, whose only importer is the dead `src/cli/help.ts` shim |

`DESTRUCTIVE_REMOVE_BLOCKED` (`src/domain/config.ts:48-54`) is only ever rendered, never produced.

#### P2-3 · Copilot-era remnants

- `runCodexLogin()` (`src/runtime/codex-cli.ts:39-53`) is the last piece of the removed
  `codex login --with-api-key` flow. Its only reference is the dead `src/infra/codex-cli.ts` shim.
- `CODEX_LOGIN_FAILED` (`src/domain/errors.ts`) exists only for that dead function, yet is reused as
  the catch-all fallback for Codex probe failures in `src/app/run-doctor.ts:94-97`.
- `setCodexSpawnImplementation` / `resetCodexSpawnImplementation` (`src/runtime/codex-cli.ts:25-34`)
  exist for tests that no longer call them.
- `AGENTS.md:33` still instructs contributors to keep Copilot runtime checks scoped to Copilot
  workflows — guidance for a feature removed in 0.2.1.

#### P2-4 · Unused parameters reveal a half-retired code path

`addProvider()` accepts `authPath` and `createProfile` and never reads them
(`src/app/add-provider.ts:26`, `:34`). `editProvider()` accepts `authPath`, `createProfile`, and
`switchToProfile` and never reads them (`src/app/edit-provider.ts:23`, `:31-32`). The handlers
compute and pass all of them.

#### P2-5 · The hand-rolled TOML parser is ~15% of the codebase and fails silently

`src/domain/config.ts` is 1,143 lines — the largest file in the repository — built on a line-scanner
with three regex matchers (`:992-1046`). Its failure mode is the problem: **anything it does not
recognise is treated as absent, never as an error.**

Consequences:

- `"""multi-line"""` strings are invisible → the field looks missing.
- Arrays, inline tables, and dotted keys are unsupported.
- `requires_openai_auth = True` (capitalised) does not match; only lowercase `true`.
- An unterminated quote matches nothing, silently.
- Root fields keep the **first** occurrence of a duplicate key; section fields keep the **last**
  (`:259-340`) — inconsistent, with no diagnostic either way.

So `doctor` can report `MODEL_MISSING` for a `config.toml` that plainly has the field. The
byte-offset patch approach itself is sound (operations are applied in descending offset order,
`:728-744`) — the weakness is entirely in recognition coverage.

`expandDeletionEnd()` (`:1107-1122`) computes a cursor value and then never uses it; the second half
of the function is a no-op.

#### P2-6 · Documentation drift

`docs/cli-usage.md:3,9`, `docs/codex-switch-product-overview.md:3`, and
`docs/codex-switch-technical-architecture.md:3` all still declare `0.2.1` and contain no `--claude`
content — yet `README.md:193` and `README.AI.md` list them as **current** fact sources. The release
gate explicitly tolerates this: `tests/release-contract.spec.js:39` matches `/0\.2\.1|0\.3\.0/`.

`CHANGELOG.md:29` still marks 0.2.1 as "Unreleased" though 0.2.2 and 0.3.0 shipped after it; the same
applies to the 0.1.2–0.1.5 entries.

#### P2-7 · Help and flag handling are inconsistent with the surface

- Top-level `--help` never mentions Claude Code (`src/commands/help.ts:32-81`), even though
  `CHANGELOG.md:23` states help text was updated for `--claude`. Only per-command registry usage
  lines were.
- `--claude` is **silently ignored** on the 12 commands outside `CLAUDE_COMMANDS`
  (`src/commands/claude-handlers.ts:22`). `codexs doctor --claude` runs the Codex doctor with no
  warning.
- `codexs config` prints top-level help; the nested list is reachable only via `codexs help config`.
- `codexs -h` works only by accident: `startIndex` skips index 0 (`src/commands/args.ts:66`), so the
  `-h` is never parsed as a help request — the no-command fallback prints help anyway. `codexs -h list`
  ignores `list`.
- `--codex-dir` consumes the next token unconditionally (`:22-30`), so `codexs list --codex-dir --json`
  resolves a directory literally named `--json`.
- Undocumented flags: `--create-profile` (`add`, `edit`), `--switch-to` (`edit`), `--merge`
  (`import`) are implemented but absent from the registry usage strings
  (`src/commands/registry.ts:142-143`, `:162-165`, `:222`).

#### P2-8 · Inconsistent error codes

The same "missing provider name" condition uses three different codes:
`INVALID_ARGUMENT` (`src/commands/handlers.ts:75`, `src/commands/claude-handlers.ts:168`),
`PROVIDER_NOT_FOUND` (`handlers.ts:114`, `:311`), and `CLAUDE_PROVIDER_NOT_FOUND`
(`claude-handlers.ts:138`, `:196`).

The empty-registry picker error differs the same way: `PROVIDER_NOT_FOUND` "No providers are
configured." (`src/interaction/interactive.ts:55`) vs `CLAUDE_PROVIDERS_NOT_FOUND`
(`claude-handlers.ts:232`).

#### P2-9 · Unreachable branches

`UNKNOWN_COMMAND` (`src/commands/dispatch.ts:19`, `src/commands/handlers.ts:476-477`) cannot be
reached from argv — `parseArgs` can only produce a registry id or `null`. The same applies to
`findCommandDefinition`'s special-casing of `"help"`/`"version"` (`src/commands/registry.ts:309-314`).

#### P2-10 · Duplication between the two targets (accepted, documented)

The Codex and Claude layers are structural near-copies of each other:

- Domain validators: `src/domain/providers.ts:30-120` vs `src/domain/claude-providers.ts:20-90`.
- Repositories: `src/storage/providers-repo.ts:10-50` vs `src/storage/claude-providers-repo.ts:14-60`.
- Mutation actions: `src/app/claude-remove-provider.ts:16-39` is `removeProvider`'s `runMutation`
  scaffold minus the config projection; `claude-add-provider.ts:48-72` mirrors `addProvider`.
- Prompting: `promptForClaudeProviderSelection()` (`claude-handlers.ts:224-258`) re-implements
  `promptForProviderSelection()` (`src/interaction/interactive.ts:24-59`), and additionally bypasses
  the `CliPromptRuntime` abstraction by importing `inquirer` directly (`claude-handlers.ts:75`,
  `:91`, `:249`) where every Codex flow uses the runtime.
- `claude-handlers.ts:103-113` and `:115-124` are two near-identical `claudeAddProvider(...)` calls
  differing only in where `fromFile` came from.
- Path plumbing: `claude-handlers.ts:60-62` hand-rolls `lockPath` / `backupsDir` / `latestBackupPath`
  with three inline `require("node:path")` calls instead of extending `createClaudePaths()`
  (`src/storage/claude-paths.ts:34-41`), which omits those fields. The same inline-`require` pattern
  appears at `src/app/run-mutation.ts:27` and `src/storage/lock-repo.ts:18`.

Roughly 300–350 of ~500 lines are structural repetition. **This is accepted, not scheduled** — see
§4.

#### P2-11 · Packaging and release surface

- `engines.node` is `>=18` (`package.json:25`) and `README.md:26` repeats it, but the sole runtime
  dependency declares `>=23.5.0 || ^22.13.0 || ^21.7.0 || ^20.12.0`
  (`node_modules/inquirer/package.json`). On Node 18/19 the install is unsupported.
- `files` ships the entire `docs/` tree — including archived 0.1.x PRD/Design documents — while
  **excluding** `README.CN.md`, `README.AI.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` (`package.json:10-15`). Chinese
  users installing from npm never see the Chinese README.
- No `types` field and no emitted `.d.ts` — the package is untyped for TypeScript consumers.
- **No CI.** There is no `.github/` directory; the release gate only ever runs locally.
- **21 npm versions, 0 git tags.** `git tag` returns nothing.

#### P2-12 · Local machine leftovers

Empty `bin/` (also gitignored), `tmp/isolated-codex-validation/` (June 2026, containing a full Codex
runtime state: `auth.json`, sqlite logs, sandbox logs), and the `~/.config/codex-switch/` artifacts
listed in §1.

---

## 3. Roadmap

Ordered so that each phase is independently shippable and reviewable.

### Phase 1 — `0.3.1` Security patch

No architecture change. Highest value per line changed.

**Design: [`docs/Design/codex-switch-v0.3.1-design.md`](./Design/codex-switch-v0.3.1-design.md).**

**Status: shipped in `0.3.1` (2026-09-20).** All six items landed. Three deviations from this plan,
recorded in the Design document's Implementation Notes:

- `--reveal` shipped as a **global** flag, not a `CLAUDE_COMMANDS` flag. The command-option pass
  treats any `--x <non-flag>` pair as a valued option, so a per-command `--reveal` would swallow
  the provider name that follows it. Fixing that parser is P1-1 (Phase 2).
- Item 4 warns that the export holds plaintext keys, but does not suggest `export --redact`. A
  redacted export mode is out of scope for this release.
- Item 6's allowlist is built by the **caller**, not read from the manifest: a root recorded inside
  the manifest is tamperable by the same edit that redirects a restore path.

1. **Mask Claude secrets by default; add `--reveal`.**
   - `claudeShowProvider()` stops returning the raw `settings` blob; `env` values are masked through
     `maskSecret()` for any key matching a secret pattern
     (`*_TOKEN`, `*_KEY`, `*_SECRET`, `*_PASSWORD`, `ANTHROPIC_*`).
   - `--reveal` (registered in `CLAUDE_COMMANDS`' flag set) restores current behaviour.
   - `--json` masks too. Add a second-pass guard in `renderClaudeHumanSuccess()`'s `show` case
     (`src/cli/output.ts:392-398`) so a future service-layer change cannot silently re-leak.
   - **Acceptance:** `codexs show --claude deepseek` contains no real token;
     `codexs show --claude deepseek --reveal` does.
2. **Tighten permissions on write.** New POSIX mode for
   `claude-providers.json`, `providers.json`, `auth.json` (`0o600`), and backup directories
   (`0o700`), applied in `writeTextFileAtomic()` / `ensureDir()` with a platform check that is a
   no-op on Windows. Repair the existing 4 files on next write.
   - **Acceptance:** `stat -c %a ~/.config/codex-switch/claude-providers.json` reports `600` on
     Linux/macOS after any mutation; no error on Windows.
3. **Widen error-detail masking.** Replace the `"apikey"` substring test
   (`src/storage/fs-utils.ts:59-61`) with a key-name regex, and mask values inside nested objects
   instead of `JSON.stringify`-ing them whole.
4. **Make `export` loud.** Warn in the result payload and in human output when the exported payload
   contains keys; suggest `codexs export --redact` as a follow-up option.
5. **Fix the non-atomic writes.** Drop the redundant `rmSync` from `writeTextFileAtomic()`
   (`src/storage/fs-utils.ts:20-22`) — Node's `renameSync` already replaces on both platforms — and
   route `writeOpenAiApiKeyAuth()` (`src/storage/auth-repo.ts:83`) through the helper.
   - **Acceptance:** a `writeFileSync`-injected failure mid-mutation leaves the previous file intact.
6. **Add a containment check to rollback.** `restoreManifest()` refuses to write outside the
   directory recorded in the manifest, or outside an allowlist of managed paths.

### Phase 2 — `0.4.0` Stability

The four items selected for this cycle.

1. **Stale-lock recovery.**
   - On conflict, `acquireLock()` reads the pid and probes it with `process.kill(pid, 0)`.
   - Dead pid → take over, emit a warning, append an audit line.
   - Add a TTL fallback for the case where the pid was recycled.
   - Add `codexs unlock` as an explicit, documented escape hatch.
   - **Acceptance:** `kill -9` a mutating command mid-flight, then confirm the next mutation
     succeeds without manual file deletion.
2. **Backup retention.**
   - `codexs backups prune [--keep N]`, default retention 20, newest-first.
   - `createTimestamp()` gains millisecond precision (or a short random suffix) so same-second
     mutations cannot collide (P0-4).
   - `runMutation()` removes its own backup directory when the mutation fails (after restore), so
     failed attempts stop accumulating.
   - Clean up the 98 existing directories on this machine once `prune` exists.
   - **Acceptance:** after 25 mutations, `backups/` holds 20 directories; two mutations in the same
     second produce two distinct directories.
3. **Boolean flag parsing.**
   - Add a `booleanFlags: string[]` field to `CommandDefinition` in `src/commands/registry.ts`
     (`--claude`, `--force`, `--merge`, `--overwrite`, `--create-profile`, `--reveal`).
   - `parseArgs()` stops consuming the next token for entries in that set
     (`src/commands/args.ts:75-88`).
   - **Backward compatibility is verified:** `resolveClaudeProviderName()`
     (`src/commands/claude-handlers.ts:37-48`) already prefers `positionals[0]`, so
     `codexs add --claude copilot --from-file x` keeps working with `copilot` landing as a
     positional. The helper can then be deleted entirely.
   - Fix the `required` parameter of `getSingleOption()` or remove it (P1-2).
   - **Acceptance:** `codexs remove --force <name>` works for both targets;
     `resolveClaudeProviderName` no longer exists.
4. **Exit codes and the error envelope.**
   - Unknown command → exit 1 (`src/cli.ts:52-55`).
   - Wrap `main()`'s synchronous section in `try`/`catch` → `outputFailure` (`src/cli.ts:27-28`).
   - Fix the empty `status` field (`src/cli/output.ts:164`).
   - **Acceptance:** `codexs lst; echo $?` prints `1`; `codexs --codex-dir; echo $?` prints `1` with
     a structured error, not a stack trace.
5. **CI and test portability.**
   - New `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: `npm ci` → `npx tsc --noEmit` → `npm test`, matrix of
     `windows-latest` + `ubuntu-latest` × Node 20/22.
   - Replace the `dev-codex/local-sandbox` dependency with a sandbox the tests generate themselves
     (`tests/helpers.js:8`), so a fresh clone can run the suite.
   - Fix the temp-directory leaks in `makeSandboxCopy()` and `runBuiltCli()`.
   - **New `tests/claude-provider-workflow.spec.js`** covering add → switch → list → current → show
     → remove, plus the P0-1 masking behaviour and the `--reveal` path.
   - **Acceptance:** `git clean -xdf && npm ci && npm test` passes on Windows and Linux.

### Phase 3 — `0.4.x` Maintainability

1. **Delete the dead code** (one commit, easy to review): all of `src/infra/`, the 5 dead `src/cli/`
   shims, every export in P2-2, the copilot-era remnants in P2-3, and the unused parameters in P2-4.
2. **Resync the docs.** Bring `docs/cli-usage.md`, `docs/codex-switch-product-overview.md`, and
   `docs/codex-switch-technical-architecture.md` to the current version with `--claude` sections, and
   tighten `tests/release-contract.spec.js:39` to a single current version so drift fails the build.
   Remove the Copilot paragraph from `AGENTS.md:33`. Fix the "Unreleased" markers in `CHANGELOG.md`.
   Add a Claude section to top-level help (`src/commands/help.ts:32-81`). Document the
   currently-undocumented flags in the registry usage strings.
3. **Packaging.** Move `engines.node` to `>=20.12` (or pin a compatible `inquirer`). Add
   `README.CN.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` to `files`; exclude archived `docs/PRD` and `docs/Design`
   directories from the tarball. Decide whether to emit `.d.ts`. Start tagging releases — 21
   published versions with zero tags makes bisecting impossible.
4. **Machine cleanup** (needs explicit confirmation before touching anything outside the repo):
   `github-token`, `runtime/copilot-bridge*`, `tmp/isolated-codex-validation/`, the empty `bin/`.

### Phase 4 — `0.5+` Open decision: the TOML parser

Two options, deliberately left open:

**(a) Keep the hand-rolled parser, make it fail loudly.** Any line the matchers cannot recognise
becomes an explicit diagnostic instead of silently-absent data, so `doctor` stops reporting false
`MODEL_MISSING` (P2-5). Small, and it preserves comments and formatting — which is exactly what the
byte-offset patch approach buys.

**(b) Parse with a real TOML library** (`smol-toml`), keep the byte-offset patcher for writes. The
read path becomes trustworthy; the cost is a second runtime dependency against the "lightweight"
goal.

**Recommendation: (a) now, (b) only if a real parsing failure is reported by a user.** The parser's
correctness problem is its silence, not its coverage.

## 4. Explicitly Rejected

| Not doing | Why |
|---|---|
| A generic "target" abstraction, or merging into one `providers.json` | Already a written non-goal in the 0.3.0 PRD and Design. The Claude path is ~700 lines; the payoff does not justify a storage-format migration. Confirmed as the direction for this cycle. |
| Re-introducing copilot-sdk, the HTTP bridge, or the proxy runtime | Removed deliberately in 0.2.1. `package-lock.json` is clean. No reason to regress. |
| Unifying the Codex and Claude domain/storage/app layers behind a shared `ProviderRegistry<T>` | ~300–350 lines of the ~500 structural repetition would collapse, but it trades the clarity of two independent targets for indirection — and contradicts the decision above. Phase 3 removes the dead code instead. |
| A `--target` flag replacing `--claude` | Same reasoning. `--claude` is already documented and shipped. |
| Adding an exit-code taxonomy (2 for usage errors, etc.) | Phase 2 only needs "success vs. failure" to be correct. A taxonomy is a behaviour change with no current consumer. |

## 5. Decisions and Open Questions

**Decided — Codex `show --json` keeps emitting the full `apiKey`.** It is documented as an
automation contract (`src/commands/registry.ts:103-106`) and is left unchanged. Phase 1 masks only
the Claude side. Unifying the two would be a breaking JSON-contract change with no benefit for a
single-user local tool. Recorded as a non-goal in the v0.3.1 design.

**Decided — `--reveal` is a global flag**, parsed in `parseArgs()`'s first pass alongside `--json`.
Per-command registration would collide with the greedy `--flag value` rule (P1-1) and make
`codexs show --reveal <name>` swallow the provider name. Settled in the v0.3.1 design, §1.

**Still open — should `backups prune` run automatically** after every mutation, or only on demand?
Automatic caps growth with no user action; on-demand keeps mutations side-effect-free. Phase 2.
