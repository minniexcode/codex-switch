# Testing

Current version: `0.4.1`

There are two suites, and they cover different things on purpose.

## The in-process suite

`npm test` rebuilds the CLI and runs `tests/run-tests.js`, which discovers `tests/*.spec.js` files. Each spec exports `{ name, tests: [{ name, run() }] }`; a spec whose tests throw is reported and the runner continues with the next one. A spec that throws while being loaded is reported the same way, and the run continues.

**Silence means green.** A passing run prints nothing. This is deliberate for a suite this size, and it is why a fixture problem shows up as a wall of failures rather than as a quietly skipped case.

Tests call `runCli(argv, io)` in-process through `runBuiltCli()`, which means they exercise the production dispatch ladder rather than a hand-written mirror of it. What they structurally cannot observe is a real process exit code, a real pipe, or a real environment.

Every temporary directory is created through `makeTempDir()` in `tests/helpers.js`, which registers it for removal. `run-tests.js` calls `cleanupTempDirs()` after each suite and a `process.on("exit")` backstop covers the failure path, so a full run leaves nothing behind. Nothing calls `fs.rmSync` on a test directory directly.

`runBuiltCli()` points `CODEXS_CODEX_DIR` at a temporary directory whenever the call passes no `--codex-dir`, so a spec that forgets it cannot reach a real `~/.codex`. `withClaudeEnv()` is the only safe way to run a Claude command: it verifies `CODEXS_CLAUDE_DIR` resolves inside a temporary directory before running anything, because `switch --claude` replaces `settings.json`. **Pass `--json` on every Claude spec invocation** — `canPrompt()` is true whenever the suite runs in a terminal, so a missing `--json` blocks on an inquirer prompt and hangs the suite instead of failing it.

## The real-process suite

`npm run test:e2e` builds the CLI and runs `tests/e2e/run-e2e.js`, which discovers `tests/e2e/*.spec.js` in order. Each case runs the built binary as a **real child process** via `spawnSync`, with real pipes, real exit codes, and real argv.

`tests/run-tests.js` does not descend into `tests/e2e/`; the two suites are separately invocable and CI runs them as two steps. The E2E suite costs a process spawn per case, which is too much to pay inside the fast suite for every contributor.

Unlike the in-process runner, this one **prints a per-case line and a summary** (`passed: N   failed: N   skipped: N`). Silence-means-green would hide exactly the environment-dependent gap the suite exists to expose.

The isolation is the point:

- One sandbox root per case, holding `home/`, `codex/`, and `claude/`.
- All three roots are asserted to resolve inside the sandbox **before any child process runs**, and the sandbox is asserted not to sit inside the repo or the user's home directory.
- The child environment is built explicitly: `process.env` minus every ambient `CODEXS_*` and minus `NODE_ENV`, plus the three overrides.
- If a check fails the runner **refuses to run**, rather than warning.

A developer's real `~/.codex`, `~/.claude`, and `~/.config/codex-switch` are never touched. That matters beyond tidiness: the first mutating command against a real tool home prunes its backups to the retention count, irreversibly.

Interactive (inquirer) paths are out of scope for both suites this round: a TTY is required, so every selector, confirmation, and `migrate` wizard branch is uncovered.

## Commands

```bash
npm run build
npx tsc --noEmit
npm test          # in-process; prints nothing on success
npm run test:e2e  # real processes; prints passed/failed/skipped
node dist/cli.js --help
node dist/cli.js --version
npm pack --dry-run
```

## Required Coverage

Focus on the dual-target contract, the `0.4.1` recovery guarantees, and the `0.3.1` secret-handling guarantees:

- Version metadata is `0.4.1` in `package.json` and both spots in `package-lock.json`, and `codexs --version` prints it.
- Current docs point to `docs/PRD/codex-switch-prd-v0.4.1.md` and `docs/Design/codex-switch-v0.4.1-design.md`, and the PRD/Design pair exists for every version on the `0.2.1 → 0.4.1` line.
- Help exposes only current commands: `init`, `migrate`, `list`, `show`, `current`, `status`, `config show`, `config list-profiles`, `add`, `edit`, `switch`, `remove`, `import`, `export`, `backups list`, `backups prune`, `unlock`, `rollback`, `doctor`, and deprecated `setup`.
- Fresh provider flow: `init -> add -> switch -> status -> doctor`.
- Base URL drift diagnostics.
- Ambiguous active provider mapping.
- `migrate` remains an advanced adopt helper.
- `setup` remains a deprecated pointer.
- JSON output uses the stable envelope.
- `show --claude` masks credential-shaped env values and omits `settings`; `--reveal` returns real values and includes `settings`.
- `--reveal` placed before the provider name still resolves that name as a positional.
- `list --claude` and `current --claude` expose no secret material.
- Error-detail redaction covers nested keys and key names other than `apikey`.
- `export` reports `containsSecrets` and warns when exported records hold plaintext keys.
- `writeTextFileAtomic` leaves the destination present and intact at rename time, and retries a Windows-transient rename failure instead of aborting the mutation.
- `restoreManifest` rejects a restore path outside the allowed roots and leaves the named file untouched.
- On POSIX, a managed write lands at `0600` for files and `0700` for created directories.
- The suite runs green with no `dev-codex/` present; Codex fixtures are generated per test by `makeCodexFixture()`.
- The Claude provider workflow (`add`, `switch`, `list`, `current`, `show`, `remove`) runs end to end against a `CODEXS_CLAUDE_DIR` that is verified to sit inside a temporary directory.

### Recovery

- A stale lock — owner pid gone — is taken over rather than blocking the write, and `doctor` reports it as `LOCK_STALE`.
- A live lock is never taken over; `doctor` reports `LOCK_OCCUPIED` and `unlock` refuses with `LOCK_CONFLICT`.
- `unlock` succeeds as a no-op when no lock is present, and `--force` clears a live lock.
- Retention keeps the newest `N`, deletes the rest, and **never** deletes a directory a surviving manifest still references.
- A failed-and-rolled-back mutation does not leave its backup directory behind.
- Two mutations in the same second produce two distinct backups.

### Process-level (E2E only)

- An unrecognized command exits `1` with a structured error; a bare group root exits `0`.
- A synchronous parse failure produces the envelope on stderr under `--json`, and never on stdout.
- Boolean flags are position-independent, and `--claude` placed before the command name resolves.
- `--codex-dir` refuses a following flag instead of taking it as the path.
- `--claude` is refused on a command with no Claude path.
- Every mutating command has an asserted human rendering, not only a JSON envelope.

Do not add tests for removed `0.2.1` runtime experiments such as Copilot SDK integration, GitHub login, `add --copilot`, or bridge commands.

## Known Gaps

- The POSIX permission assertions in `tests/secret-handling.spec.js` return early on Windows, so the `0600` / `0700` code path has no executable coverage on that platform. The `ubuntu-latest` leg of `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is the only place it runs.
- Interactive paths — inquirer selectors, confirmations, `migrate`'s wizard, `PROMPT_CANCELLED` — have no coverage in either suite.
- The E2E suite proves the binary works against synthetic roots. It does not prove that a developer's live configuration survives a real `switch`; nothing in the repo exercises a real `~/.codex` or `~/.claude`, deliberately.
- `migrate` is the one command that ignores `CODEXS_CODEX_DIR` (`codexDirExplicit` is set only by a literal `--codex-dir`). Its non-interactive surface is covered; its happy path needs a TTY and is not.
