# Changelog

## 0.4.1 - 2026-09-20

Stateful-recovery release. Two commands added, both aimed at a state the tool could previously enter and not leave: a lock whose owner no longer exists, and a backups directory that grows without bound.

### Added

- `codexs unlock [--force]` — clears a lock left behind by a process that is provably gone. Idempotent: a missing lock is success. Refuses when the recorded owner is still alive, and names it; `--force` is the documented override.
- `codexs backups prune [--keep N]` — deletes backup directories newest-first, keeping `N` (default 20). Never deletes a directory that a surviving manifest still names, so a rollback route is protected by every backup that references it, not only the newest.
- Automatic retention: every mutating command prunes to the default depth and reports how many backups it removed.
- `doctor` reports an occupied or stale lock as a finding, with the owning pid.
- `LOCK_STALE` error code and a stale-lock takeover path in `runMutation()`.
- `tests/lock-recovery.spec.js`, `tests/backup-retention.spec.js`, `tests/atomic-write.spec.js`, `tests/arg-parsing.spec.js`, `tests/cli-process.spec.js`, and the `tests/e2e/` real-process suite with its own runner and CI step.
- PRD v0.4.0/Design v0.4.0 and PRD v0.4.1/Design v0.4.1 fact sources.

### Changed

- Backup directory names gain zero-padded milliseconds and are created exclusively, so two mutations in the same second no longer overwrite each other's backup. The created directory reports its own path rather than being re-derived from the timestamp.
- A mutation that fails and rolls back successfully no longer leaves its own backup directory behind.
- Windows: `writeTextFileAtomic()` retries a rename that fails with `EPERM`/`EACCES`/`EBUSY`. Those codes are what an antivirus or indexer produces by holding the destination open for a moment, and treating them as permanent aborted a mutation that would have succeeded.
- `add --create-profile` and `edit --create-profile` now actually write the `[profiles.<id>]` section. The flag was parsed, threaded to both app services, and then dropped, so it had never had an effect; the interactive `add` collector, which prompts for the model and base URL precisely because it believes it writes that section, was writing nothing.
- `--claude` on a command with no Claude path is refused (`INVALID_ARGUMENT`, naming the supported commands) instead of being silently ignored. `codexs status --claude` used to report Codex state under a flag that asked about Claude.

### Fixed

- `--codex-dir` no longer accepts a flag as its value. `codexs list --codex-dir --json` resolved a directory literally named `--json`, dropped the JSON request, and reported an empty provider list as success.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-09-20

Foundation release: no new command and no storage change. It makes the failure surface honest to scripts and makes the suite runnable where it is checked out.

### Added

- CI on Windows and Linux against Node 20 and 22: install, type-check, `npm test`.
- `runCli(argv, io)` as the single implementation of the entry ladder. It takes line-oriented sinks and returns an exit code instead of calling `process.exit`, so the in-process tests exercise the real dispatch rather than a hand-written mirror of it.
- Temporary-directory registry with an `exit` backstop; `makeCodexFixture()` generates the Codex `config.toml` / `auth.json` per test instead of copying a gitignored directory.
- `--claude` runtime coverage end to end: `tests/claude-provider-workflow.spec.js`, driven through `withClaudeEnv()` so it cannot reach a real `~/.claude`.
- `tests/release-contract.spec.js` asserts the version in `package.json`, both `package-lock.json` fields, and `--version` output, and that the PRD/Design pair for each line exists.

### Changed

- `--claude`, `--force`, `--merge`, `--overwrite`, and `--create-profile` are true boolean flags and no longer consume the token after them. `--claude` is position-independent, so `codexs --claude list` resolves.
- An unrecognized command exits `1` with `INVALID_ARGUMENT` instead of exiting `0` with the top-level help. A bare group root (`codexs config`) still prints that group's help and exits `0`.
- A synchronous parse failure produces the structured error envelope when `--json` is present, instead of escaping as a stack trace.
- `status` reports the tool-home root in both human and JSON output. The field was populated only in the JSON payload under a path the human renderer never read, so the human view printed an empty string.
- `resolveClaudeProviderName()` deleted; Claude provider names arrive as positionals like the Codex ones.
- `getSingleOption()`'s `required` parameter deleted — both of its branches returned `null`.

### Security

- Codex `show --json` continues to return the full `apiKey` by design. It is a documented automation contract and is unchanged by this release; Claude `show` still masks in both modes.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-09-20

Security patch release for the `0.3.0` dual-target line. No architecture change: the `--claude` path, both registries, and the command surface are unchanged.

### Added

- Global `--reveal` flag. `show --claude <name>` now masks credential-shaped env values by default; `--reveal` is the explicit opt-in that prints the real values and includes the raw `settings` blob.
- `export` reports `secretCount` and `containsSecrets`, and emits a warning when exported provider records contain API keys in plaintext.
- New `src/domain/secrets.ts` as the single source of truth for secret-key detection and masking; `maskSecret()` moved there from `src/domain/providers.ts`.
- `ROLLBACK_PATH_REJECTED` error code.
- `tests/secret-handling.spec.js` covering masking, `--reveal`, error-detail redaction, atomic writes, export warnings, and rollback containment.
- PRD v0.3.1 and Design v0.3.1 fact sources.

### Changed

- Managed files are written with owner-only permissions (`0600` for files, `0700` for directories the tool creates) on macOS and Linux. The `chmod` is skipped on Windows, where access is governed by NTFS ACLs and `chmod` only toggles the read-only bit.
- Error details are redacted by walking the whole detail tree against the shared secret-key pattern, instead of skipping only top-level keys containing `apikey`.
- `restoreManifest()` requires an `allowedRoots` argument, sourced from the caller rather than the backup manifest, so a tampered manifest cannot redirect a restore outside the managed roots.
- The `show --claude` payload gained `revealed`, and omits `settings` unless `--reveal` is passed.
- Human `show --claude` output notes when values were masked so `--reveal` is discoverable.

### Fixed

- `writeTextFileAtomic()` no longer deletes the destination before renaming. The previous `rm`-then-`rename` left a window where the destination did not exist; `rename` alone already replaces an existing file on both platforms.
- `auth.json` writes go through the atomic helper instead of a bare `fs.writeFileSync`, closing the last non-atomic write on the mutation path and bringing the file under the permission fix.

### Security

- `show --claude <name>` no longer returns live `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` values, in human or `--json` output.
- Codex `show --json` still returns the full `apiKey` by design; it is a documented automation contract and is unchanged in this release.
- On Windows, `chmod`-based permission tightening is inert. The exposure there is at the NTFS ACL layer and is documented as an operator action in `docs/codex-switch-2.x-roadmap.md` (P0-2).

## 0.3.0 - 2026-07-18

Claude Code provider switching release.

### Added

- Claude Code provider management via `--claude` flag on `add`, `switch`, `list`, `show`, `current`, `remove` commands.
- `codexs add --claude <name> --from-file <settings.json>` imports a Claude Code settings file as a named profile.
- `codexs switch --claude <name>` atomically replaces `~/.claude/settings.json` with the stored profile.
- `codexs current --claude` detects which registered profile matches the active Claude settings.
- `codexs list --claude` shows all Claude profiles with active detection.
- `codexs show --claude <name>` displays full Claude profile details including env vars.
- `codexs remove --claude <name>` removes a Claude profile from the registry.
- Separate `claude-providers.json` storage in tool home directory.
- `CODEXS_CLAUDE_DIR` environment variable to override the Claude Code directory.
- PRD v0.3.0 and Design v0.3.0 fact sources.

### Changed

- Package description updated to reflect dual-target (Codex + Claude Code) support.
- Help text for `add`, `switch`, `list`, `show`, `current`, `remove` updated with `--claude` usage.

## 0.2.2 - 2026-07-15

Version bump and command summary update.

## 0.2.1 - Unreleased

Provider-management-only consolidation release.

- Repositioned the current development line as a local-first Codex provider/model-provider management CLI.
- Removed current-facing Copilot login, `add --copilot`, bridge command, SDK, HTTP proxy bridge, and local bridge runtime contracts from docs and command presentation.
- Added `0.2.1` PRD and design fact sources.
- Updated release-contract coverage around the reduced provider-management command surface.
## 0.1.5 - 2026-07-01

Copilot Bridge process-visibility and redaction patch release.

### Changed

- Added stable Copilot bridge runtime events for assistant intent, message deltas, reasoning deltas, tool lifecycle, permission lifecycle, user-input requests, exit-plan-mode requests, and session status signals.
- Projected Copilot process/status events into Responses streaming commentary items and reasoning/progress updates into Responses reasoning summary events.
- Forwarded adapter runtime events through the bridge worker while keeping Chat Completions streaming text-only.
- Hardened unknown SDK event summaries with key-aware and value-aware redaction plus bounded truncation.
- Added adapter-level regression coverage for raw SDK session event normalization.

## 0.1.4 - Unreleased

Bridge stability and observability release.

### Changed

- Reworked Copilot bridge reuse to retry transient health/auth probe failures before replacing an existing worker.
- Added persisted bridge runtime logging, restart reason tracking, and surfaced `logPath` metadata across bridge, switch, status, and doctor flows.
- Extended bridge runtime state and start results with persisted probe/restart metadata for diagnostics.
- Restored the interactive provider picker `current` hint for legacy top-level `profile` state when `model_provider` is absent or unresolved.
- Replaced the hard-coded test runner with deterministic `tests/*.spec.js` discovery and aligned the widened release gate with the current help, runtime, and workflow contracts.

## 0.1.3 - Unreleased

Copilot login hotfix release.

### Changed

- Replaced the legacy `CopilotClient` constructor fields with the official `RuntimeConnection.forStdio({ path })` SDK connection path.
- Resolved the managed SDK runtime against `@github/copilot/npm-loader.js` instead of relying on implicit bundled package lookup.
- Kept human `copilot --help` and `copilot login` invocations on the bundled `.bin` shim while separating SDK runtime resolution from terminal CLI resolution.
- Added a focused `0.1.3` regression spec covering the Copilot login compatibility fix.

## 0.1.2 - Unreleased

Copilot runtime repair release.

### Changed

- Pinned the managed Copilot runtime installer to `@github/copilot-sdk@1.0.2` instead of installing `latest`.
- Added a Copilot-only Node.js runtime gate. Direct providers still support Node.js `>=18`; Copilot runtime paths require Node.js `>=20`.
- Reworked SDK loading to resolve `@github/copilot-sdk` from the managed runtime install directory via `createRequire()`.
- Replaced session-based auth probing with `CopilotClient.getAuthStatus()`.
- Added explicit Copilot runtime errors for unsupported Node runtime, SDK version, SDK API shape, and bridge upstream timeout.
- Reworked the bridge worker to keep one long-lived Copilot client, create one session per request, disconnect sessions after use, and serialize requests.
- Updated Responses streaming to emit initial SSE events before the upstream request completes and to keep the connection alive with heartbeat comments.
- Added Copilot config projection for `stream_idle_timeout_ms = 300000`.

### Documentation

- Added `0.1.2` PRD and design docs describing the experimental Copilot bridge boundary.
- Removed obsolete `0.0.x` transition docs and old test reports from the active docs tree.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-05-28

Documentation and fact-source completion release.

### Changed

- Added missing `0.1.1` PRD/design fact sources.
- Aligned README, CLI usage, product overview, architecture notes, and AI-facing README around the stable `0.1.x` route model.
- Clarified that `profile` is a managed alias for the Codex `model_provider` route id.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-05-28

First stable documentation baseline.

### Added

- Stable command-surface summary for direct provider and Copilot provider workflows.
- Stable JSON envelope contract for automation.
- Stable split-state model: tool home for managed state, target Codex home for runtime projection.

### Notes

- `migrate` remains an advanced adopt helper.
- `setup` remains a deprecated compatibility entry.
- Development-version policy remains in effect: no automatic migration shims or backward-compatibility preservation logic unless explicitly requested.
